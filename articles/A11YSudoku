Making an accessible sudoku game

Color challenge - different active states
- Each cell has several different states it can be in.

Navigation challenge
- aria-disabled vs disabled
- sighted users can see disabled cells and know they are pre-populated with a value. so disabled=true works for these pre-populated cells.
- that is not true for non-sighted users. They still need these cells to be accessible in order to discover that information about their state.
- BUT, we want to accomodate both, and we can do so with some CSS:
...blah blah blah...

- Keyboard-based navigation vs Mouse-based navigation.

- Mobile A11Y vs Browser/Desktop A11Y
