Idea:
Use Open.AI's Whisper model to analyze Las Culturistas podcast episodes.

Then, write a cool, funny, technical article about it.

Main theme: The definitive list of the Las Culturistas Rules of Culture (but like more catchy).

Outline Ideas:
- Start out with light background/praise for the podcast.
- Next, walk through downloading and analyzing the episodes.
- - can I provide a google colab notebook that would allow people to run the code themselves?
- - or at the very least a python package that would allow similar analysis?
- - Analysis plans:
- - - Use this link (is there an aggregator for all podcast rss?)
        https://omnycontent.com/d/playlist/e73c998e-6e60-432f-8610-ae210140c5b1/F6816727-C503-47AC-A7AC-AE2700391B1E/935C500F-8BB0-436B-BA7F-AE2700391B49/podcast.rss
- - - For each <item> in there, there should be a <media:content> element with a type="audio/mpeg" attribute
        (is this true for all podcast RSS or just foreverdog/I<3Media?)
- - - Write a script to search through the RSS feed.
- - - For each <item>
- - - - extract the media url
- - - - - decision: download it immediately? Add it to a queue in another thread that is downloading? (like this a lot).
- - - - - once downloaded:
- - - - - - - use sqlalchemy to write metadata + audio content to sqlite? 
- - - - - - - include additional/useful metadata from the rss feed
                (would be cool to have a self-service kind of tool. find your rss feeed, point this tool at it, let it do its thing, boom you hvae a ui where you can explore word clouds/counts, topic analysis, sentiment analysis, etc.)
    - Once everything is downloaded
        - Feed through OpenAI
        - Figure out how to store:
            - Word counts
            - Words/instances of words @ timestamps?
            - "Rule of Culture" trigger phrase (+30s after)
            - Number of times Taylor/Taylor Swift vs Tayla vs Tay(? other one they say)
            - Happiest guests?
            - Most vulgar episodes?
    - Then, make some cool/typographic things to show off with.
