            I'm currently a Senior Software Systems Developer at Epic building electronic medical records software with
            TypeScript, React, C#, and M.
            I've worn many hats including product lead, team lead, and have experience throughout the full software
            development cycle with: product management,
            team leadership, project planning, and database and user interface design.
            <br>
            <br>
            I graduated from the <a href="https://sils.unc.edu">UNC School of Information & Library Science</a> with a BS in Computer and Information Sciences.
            During my time at UNC I was a linux admin at <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org">ibiblio</a>, one of the world's first online libraries
            and a stage tech with <a href="https://carolinaperformingarts.org/">Carolina Performing Arts</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            In my free time, I enjoy mountain biking, softball, volleyball, and tinkering with my various side projects.
            <br>
