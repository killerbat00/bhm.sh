    <li>My softball team, The Big Cheese, played in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.badgerlandsoftball.com/badgerland-classic">Badgerland Classic</a>. I hit a home run! (and wasn't capable of throwing the ball).</li>
    <li>My porch plants are living their best lives.</li>
    <li>I'm having a lot of fun solving the <a target="_blank" href="https://cryptopals.com">cryptopals</a> cryptography challenges <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/killerbat00/cryptopals">while getting better at using C</a>.</li>
