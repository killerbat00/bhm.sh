<ul>
    <li>Doing a lot of drawing, and aiming to take an art class this summer.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Focusing less on the results on more on the activity of drawing has helped me improve a lot.</li>
        <li>Taking the "perfection is the enemy of progress" philosophy to the max has also helped my own personal development projects.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Softball is starting relatively soon!</li>
    <li>It's likely I'll make my first 6-figure purchase this summer.</li>
    <li>Spring is coming and my general mood is (finally) improving! 6 months of winter takes a toll...</li>
</ul>

<p class="sectionHeader">Twenty Twenty (2) In Review</p>
<p>Time continues to move very quickly. I'm 1/7th the average lifespan of a Bowhead whale.</p>
<p>The transition to WFH and into a new position have been transformative in ways I haven't fully realized.
    Working from home requires a certain level of discipline that I've been flexing and growing in other areas of my
    life as well. It has been paying off in both my physical and mental well-being. It seems obvious that bodies won't
    operate well on frozen pizza, spoonfuls of peanut butter, and a 2nd shift sleeping schedule; but the results are
    really speaking for themselves.</p>
<p>I forgot how much I like to read. I'm suddenly 13 and devouring books like they're the only window into an
    exciting life I have. Except now, I'm a grown man and ALSO have friends.</p>
<p>Long distance relationships are hard, but time spent together does feel more meaningful and intentional.
    That said, there is a certain easy charm to silently sitting together with coffee on a Sunday morning knowing that
    neither of you has to make the seemingly endless drive home and back to a life where physical affection seems worlds
    away.</p>
<p>Speaking of discipline and intentionality, putting more effort into this website and my own professional
    development has been an unexpected creative outlet and boon.</p>

<p class="sectionHeader">December 2022</p>
<ul>
    <li>December was a good month; cozy, familiar, and even familial.</li>
    <li>My gift wrapping theme was black on matte black; it was a hit. I also made nametags out of an esoterica
        stickerbook I'm getting a lot of mileage out of.</li>
    <li>I got to spend a lot of time with my family. And really be myself; how cool is that?!</li>
    <li>I read Hyperion by Dan Simmons. I wasn't immediately taken by the storytelling mechanism, but I also wasn't
        displeased enough to stop reading (well, listening). I'm a fan.</li>
    <li>Advent of Code 2022!</li>
</ul>

<p class="sectionHeader">November 2022</p>
<ul>
    <li>I'm <i>loving</i> my new job.</li>
    <li>I finished Ball Lightning by Liu Cixin. I didn't realize it preceeded his Remembrance of Earth's Past trilogy,
        but I can
        certainly see the relationship. Ball Lightning doesn't go as deeply scientific and inclues realistic and
        compelling characters and relationships.
    </li>
    <li>ChatGPT/StableDiffusion/~AGI is wild and awesome in the most biblical sense of the word.</li>
    <li>Einstein has a torn ACL (or the doggy version) that has slowly been healing. It's hard to keep a good Jack
        Russell down, but I hate seeing him hurt.</li>
    <li>Working remotely is fantastic so far.</li>
</ul>

<p class="sectionHeader">October 2022</p>
<ul>
    <li>In July, August, and September I went through a crisis of confidence over whether I should continue to update
        this, leaving breadcrumbs about my life.</li>
    <li>In October I decided it was probably fine.</li>
    <li>In September, I played in a softball league with some work colleagues...finally confident in my throw again!

    <li>I am leaving my job at <a target="_blank" href="https://epic.com"

        startup world! I'm excited to be working with new tools on
        new problems.</li>
    <li>I finished Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson and really enjoyed it.</li>
    <li>I also finished the Founders Trilogy by Robert Jackson Bennett. The use of sigils and how they interact with
        reality was particularly compelling.</li>
    <li>Inktober is almost over and I'm way behind!</li>
    <li>I'm officially hanging up my sand volleyball uniform for the year after taking 3rd and 1st place in fall
        leagues.</li>
    <li>Grant Wood is cool.</li>
