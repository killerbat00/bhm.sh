    <li>I'm <i>loving</i> my new job.</li>
    <li>I finished Ball Lightning by Liu Cixin. I didn't realize it preceeded his Remembrance of Earth's Past trilogy,
        but I can
        certainly see the relationship. Ball Lightning doesn't go as deeply scientific and inclues realistic and
        compelling characters and relationships.

    <li>ChatGPT/StableDiffusion/~AGI is wild and awesome in the most biblical sense of the word.</li>
    <li>Einstein has a torn ACL (or the doggy version) that has slowly been healing. It's hard to keep a good Jack
        Russell down, but I hate seeing him hurt.</li>
    <li>Working remotely is fantastic so far.</li>

<ul>
    <li>In July, August, and September I went through a crisis of confidence over whether I should continue to update
        this, leaving breadcrumbs about my life.</li>
    <li>In October I decided it was probably fine.</li>
    <li>In September, I played in a softball league with some work colleagues...finally confident in my throw again!

    <li>I am leaving my job at <a target="_blank" href="https://epic.com"
            title="Link to the Epic Systems website">Epic</a> to work for <a target="_blank" href="https://acuitymd.com"
            title="Link to the AcuityMD website">AcuityMD</a>. Hello,
        startup world! I'm excited to be working with new tools on
        new problems.</li>
    <li>I finished Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson and really enjoyed it.</li>
    <li>I also finished the Founders Trilogy by Robert Jackson Bennett. The use of sigils and how they interact with
        reality was particularly compelling.</li>
    <li>Inktober is almost over and I'm way behind!</li>
    <li>I'm officially hanging up my sand volleyball uniform for the year after taking 3rd and 1st place in fall
        leagues.</li>
    <li>Grant Wood is cool.</li>

    do stuff even when the weather sucks, and wisdom to know when to stay inside.</i>
