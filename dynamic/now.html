    <li>In July, August, and September I went through a crisis of confidence over whether I should continue to update
        this, leaving breadcrumbs about my life.</li>
    <li>In October I decided it was probably fine.</li>
    <li>In September, I played in a softball league with some work colleagues...finally confident in my throw again!
    </li>
    <li>I am leaving my job at <a target="_blank" href="https://epic.com">Epic</a> to work for <a target="_blank"
            href="https://acuitymd.com">AcuityMD</a>. Hello, startup world! I'm excited to be working with new tools on
        new problems.</li>
    <li>I finished Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson and really enjoyed it.</li>
    <li>I also finished the Founders Trilogy by Robert Jackson Bennett. The use of sigils and how they interact with
        reality was particularly compelling.</li>
    <li>Inktober is almost over and I'm way behind!</li>
    <li>I'm officially hanging up my sand volleyball uniform for the year after taking 3rd and 1st place in fall
        leagues.</li>
    <li>Grant Wood is cool.</li>

    <li>My softball team, The Big Cheese, played in the <a target="_blank"

        wasn't capable of throwing the ball).</li>
    <li>My porch plants are living their best lives.</li>
    <li>I'm having a lot of fun solving the <a target="_blank" href="https://cryptopals.com">cryptopals</a> cryptography
        challenges <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/killerbat00/cryptopals">while getting better at using

    <li>Sand volleyball and softball started again!</li>
    <li>I rebuilt my website (you're using the new version now!)</li>
    <li>Spending a fair bit of time in Des Moines with Eric.</li>
    <li>Writing more <a target="_blank" href="https://nim-lang.org">nim</a> but staying plugged into the Python & C#
        ecosystems.</li>
    <li>Curious to learn more about erlang/elixir.</li>
