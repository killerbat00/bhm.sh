        Won 2nd place in the fall volleyball league after a very wet and chilly night. Even with this being documented, I'll forget how uncomfortable I was and sign up again next year.
    </li>
    <li>
        My fall softball team didn't fare as well and got 4th out of 6. It's a huge improvement for us, though, considering we've previously had last place pretty locked down.

    <li>
        I'm going to have to read a LOT of books in November to hit my goal of reading all Hugo Award for Best Novel winners. I'm currently at 17 out of (now!) 73.

        I've now read 13 of 72 Hugo Award for Best Novel novels. This resolution may
        carry over to next year. I'm also realizing I should have read in an
        oldest-first order because I'm currently seeing the more developed versions
        of tropes before their foundational counterparts.

        My softball team (The Big Cheese) won The Cheese Cup at the

        fun to win, but technically The Cheese Cup is the loser's

        6 months at AcuityMD! I've learned a ton about a more 'dujour' tech stack
        (goodbye Cach√©/MUMPS!), and been able to bring my enterprise experience
        (wow, what a phrase) into play in relevant ways.

        Visited NYC for the first time in ~15 years. Got to see Stonewall as well as
        the inside of several NY-state airports - thanks, United! (regardless of
        what people say, they're #1 in making sure you spend an extra day at your
        destination after you've already lined up everything to be home at a

<p class="sectionHeader">Twenty Twenty (2) In Review</p>
<p>
    Time continues to move very quickly. I'm 1/7th the average lifespan of a
    Bowhead whale.
</p>
<p>
    The transition to WFH and into a new position have been transformative in ways
    I haven't fully realized. Working from home requires a certain level of
    discipline that I've been flexing and growing in other areas of my life as
    well. It has been paying off in both my physical and mental well-being. It
    seems obvious that bodies won't operate well on frozen pizza, spoonfuls of
    peanut butter, and a 2nd shift sleeping schedule; but the results are really
    speaking for themselves.
</p>
<p>
    I forgot how much I like to read. I'm suddenly 13 and devouring books like
    they're the only window into an exciting life I have. Except now, I'm a grown
    man and ALSO have friends.
</p>
<p>
    Long distance relationships are hard, but time spent together does feel more
    meaningful and intentional. That said, there is a certain easy charm to
    silently sitting together with coffee on a Sunday morning knowing that neither
    of you has to make the seemingly endless drive home and back to a life where
    physical affection seems worlds away.
</p>
<p>
    Speaking of discipline and intentionality, putting more effort into this
    website and my own professional development has been an unexpected creative
    outlet and boon.

        My gift wrapping theme was black on matte black; it was a hit. I also made

        I read Hyperion by Dan Simmons. I wasn't immediately taken by the

        I finished Ball Lightning by Liu Cixin. I didn't realize it preceeded his
        Remembrance of Earth's Past trilogy, but I can certainly see the
        relationship. Ball Lightning doesn't go as deeply scientific and inclues
        realistic and compelling characters and relationships.

        In July, August, and September I went through a crisis of confidence over
