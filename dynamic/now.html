<p class="sectionHeader">2023 goals retrospective</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">Out of 20 individual goals, I completed 7, made good progress on 1 more and left 12 to tackle
    next year. I'm happy with that; these are just as much directional guidance as they are to
    actually complete.</p>
<p class="subSectionHeader">‚úì Shepherd a major product release at AcuityMD</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">This year I contributed to A LOT of product feature releases (many more than a year's-worth at
    my previous
    employer,
    though those projects tended to be much larger). I: improved UX for displaying & filtering data in a user's
    sales pipeline, developed leadership
    reporting views & KPI dashboards, and helped complete a core app data model migration.</p>

<p class="subSectionHeader">‚úó Contribute to an open source project</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While I wrote more code this year than any years previous not much of it was
    open source or public. I'll carry this over to 2024.</p>
<ul>
    <li>in the graphics space</li>
    <li>in the OS/networking space</li>
    <li>in the AI space</li>
    <li>in the nim ecosystem</li>
    <li>in the python ecosystem</li>
</ul>
<p class="subSectionHeader">‚úó Release an open source project</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø</p>

<p class="subSectionHeader">‚úó Make money from something other than my job</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">Not yet, but I have improved skills that could result in payment this year.</p>

<p class="subSectionHeader">‚óã Read all Hugo Award for Best Novel winners</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">I read 25 out of 72. ~35%. 72 books is <i>a lot</i> but I think I'll be able to finish this
    year.</p>

<p class="subSectionHeader">‚úì Catch up on my growing list of purchased yet unread books</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">Success! In addition to the 25 Hugos, I read ~15 other books. I did receive more books, but
    the stack has not grown!</p>

<p class="subSectionHeader">‚úó (re)become conversational in French</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">Maybe somewhat less language atrophy this year, but not great progress.</p>

<p class="subSectionHeader">‚úó Become conversational at a basic level in German</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">Fell off hard on this one...</p>

<p class="subSectionHeader">Un-(publicly)-documented goals</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These were some additional goals that were confined to my phone's note app
    and now public for
    all to see.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        ‚úó 3x beach trips. Not this.
    </li>
    <li>
        ‚úì More time with family. For the very general 'more time' this was a success. I'll always take even more.
    </li>
    <li>
        ‚úì Lots of pushups. More than 2022, less than I'd have liked.
    </li>
    <li>
        ‚úì Lots of workouts. 158 total.
    </li>
    <li>
        ‚úó Lots of mountain biking. This one's really embarrassing...only once.
    </li>
    <li>
        ‚úó Lots of snowboarding. See above :(
    </li>
    <li>
        ‚úì More concerts/shows/vinyl. Not fully back in the scene but getting there!
        <ul>
            <li>The Shins</li>
            <li>Queens of the Stone Age</li>
            <li>Death Cab For Cutie</li>
            <li>The Postal Service üò±</li>
            <li>The Midnight</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        ‚úì Take an art class. I took two!
    </li>
</ul>

<p class="sectionHeader">December 2023</p>
<ul>
    <li>Holiday celebrations happened! Family! Food! It was great!</li>
    <li>We're shipping new features, baby!</li>
    <li>I'm discovering being on top of things requires starting earlier and earlier each year.</li>
</ul>

<p class="sectionHeader">November 2023</p>
<ul>
    <li>I visited North Carolina for a week during the holidays as I continue to lean into working remotely.</li>
    <li>The head and facial anatomy class I took was really enjoyable but taking an art class virtually is probably akin
        to trying to read a book through a foggy shower door.</li>
    <li>I'm a little ahead pace on Christmas shopping but my crippling need to give a good gift will surely leave me
        scrambling.</li>
</ul>

<p class="sectionHeader">October 2023</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Won 2nd place in the fall volleyball league after a very wet and chilly night. Even with this being documented,
        I'll forget how uncomfortable I was and sign up again next year.
    </li>
    <li>
        My fall softball team didn't fare as well and got 4th out of 6. It's a huge improvement for us, though,
        considering we've previously had last place pretty locked down.
    </li>
    <li>
        I'm going to have to read a LOT of books in November to hit my goal of reading all Hugo Award for Best Novel
        winners. I'm currently at 17 out of (now!) 73.

        I'm now registered for two (2!) art classes this fall. Only a little
        nervous.

<ul>
    <li>
        I've now read 13 of 72 Hugo Award for Best Novel novels. This resolution may
        carry over to next year. I'm also realizing I should have read in an
        oldest-first order because I'm currently seeing the more developed versions
        of tropes before their foundational counterparts.
    </li>
    <li>
        My softball team (The Big Cheese) won The Cheese Cup at the

            title="Link to the Badgerland Classic website">2023 Badgerland Classic softball tournament</a>! (It's very
        fun to win, but technically The Cheese Cup is the loser's
        bracket consolation tournament. Naming is fitting though. It just makes
        sense.)
    </li>

        6 months at AcuityMD! I've learned a ton about a more 'dujour' tech stack
        (goodbye Cach√©/MUMPS!), and been able to bring my enterprise experience
        (wow, what a phrase) into play in relevant ways.
    </li>
    <li>
        Visited NYC for the first time in ~15 years. Got to see Stonewall as well as
        the inside of several NY-state airports - thanks, United! (regardless of
        what people say, they're #1 in making sure you spend an extra day at your
        destination after you've already lined up everything to be home at a
        previously determined (and agreed upon with United) date).

<p class="sectionHeader">Twenty Twenty (2) In Review</p>
<p>
    Time continues to move very quickly. I'm 1/7th the average lifespan of a
    Bowhead whale.
</p>
<p>
    The transition to WFH and into a new position have been transformative in ways
    I haven't fully realized. Working from home requires a certain level of
    discipline that I've been flexing and growing in other areas of my life as
    well. It has been paying off in both my physical and mental well-being. It
    seems obvious that bodies won't operate well on frozen pizza, spoonfuls of
    peanut butter, and a 2nd shift sleeping schedule; but the results are really
    speaking for themselves.
</p>
<p>
    I forgot how much I like to read. I'm suddenly 13 and devouring books like
    they're the only window into an exciting life I have. Except now, I'm a grown
    man and ALSO have friends.
</p>
<p>
    Long distance relationships are hard, but time spent together does feel more
    meaningful and intentional. That said, there is a certain easy charm to
    silently sitting together with coffee on a Sunday morning knowing that neither
    of you has to make the seemingly endless drive home and back to a life where
    physical affection seems worlds away.
</p>
<p>
    Speaking of discipline and intentionality, putting more effort into this
    website and my own professional development has been an unexpected creative
    outlet and boon.

        My gift wrapping theme was black on matte black; it was a hit. I also made
        nametags out of an esoterica stickerbook I'm getting a lot of mileage out

        I read Hyperion by Dan Simmons. I wasn't immediately taken by the
        storytelling mechanism, but I also wasn't displeased enough to stop reading
        (well, listening). I'm a fan.

    <li>I'm <i>loving</i> my new job.</li>

        I finished Ball Lightning by Liu Cixin. I didn't realize it preceeded his
        Remembrance of Earth's Past trilogy, but I can certainly see the
        relationship. Ball Lightning doesn't go as deeply scientific and inclues
        realistic and compelling characters and relationships.
