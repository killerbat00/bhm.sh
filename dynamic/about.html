        management, team leadership, customer-focused product & project planning, product roadmapping, large & scalable
        systems design, and database and user interface design.</p>

            title="Link to the MyChart website">MyChart</a> team (the #1
        patient portal app with ~150mm users) securing and improving authentication & authorization frameworks in
        addition to developing a comprehensive web analytics toolset so healthcare organizations could understand how
        their patients interact with MyChart without relying on a 3rd party analytics suite. <a target="_blank"

    <p>In my free time, I enjoy mountain biking, softball, volleyball, tinkering with my various side projects, and
        making sure my dog,
        Einstein, is living the best life he can live.</p>

        <li>Type Theory & Compiler Theory (particularly parsers)</li>
        <li>Network Protocols (parsing is more fun than endless state machines, ijs)</li>
        <li>Network & Application Security (netsec)</li>
        <li>Simplicity, efficacy, and performance</li>
