    <p>Hello! My name is Brian Houston Morrow. I'm currently a Senior Full Stack Enginner at <a target="_blank"
            href="https://acuitymd.com/">AcuityMD</a> building the next generation CRM for medical device marketing.</p>
    <p>Before that, I was a Senior Software Systems Architect at <a target="_blank" href="http://epic.com">Epic</a>
        where I built electronic medical record software with TypeScript, React, C#, and M.</p>
    <p>Throughout my career, I've worn numerous hats and have learned (and continue to learn) the
        value of clear & effective communication, flexibility, accountability, and empathy.</p>
    <p>I have experience throughout the full enterprise software development lifecycle with: product & project
        management, team leadership, customer-focused product & project planning, product roadmapping, large & scalable
        systems design, and database and user interface design.</p>
    <p>Until October 2022, I worked on Epic's <a target="_blank" href="http://mychart.com">MyChart</a> team (the #1
        patient portal app with ~150mm users) securing and improving authentication & authorization frameworks in
        addition to developing a comprehensive web analytics toolset so healthcare organizations could understand how
        their patients interact with MyChart without relying on a 3rd party analytics suite. <a target="_blank"

            href="https://www.mychart.com/Features">incredibly valuable tool</a> in your personal healthcare toolkit
        (though I'm a little biased).</p>
    <p>I graduated from the <a target="_blank" href="https://sils.unc.edu">UNC School of Information & Library
            Science</a> with a BS in Computer and Information Sciences.
        During my time at UNC I was a linux admin at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ibiblio.org">ibiblio</a>, one
        of the world's first online archives (and the <a target="_blank"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibiblio">world's first internet radio host</a> in 1994 when we
        rebroadcast <a target="_blank" href="https://wxyc.org/">WXYC</a>) as well as
        a stage tech with <a target="_blank" href="https://carolinaperformingarts.org/">Carolina Performing Arts</a>.

    <p>In my free time, I enjoy mountain biking, softball, volleyball, tinkering with my various side projects, and
        making sure my dog,
        Einstein, is living the best life he can live.</p>
    <p>I'm a big fan of, and often enamored by:

        <li>Type Theory & Compiler Theory (particularly parsers)</li>
        <li>Network Protocols (parsing is more fun than endless state machines, ijs)</li>
        <li>Network & Application Security (netsec)</li>
        <li>Simplicity, efficacy, and performance</li>
        <li>To Do Lists</li>
        <li>Bell Peppers</li>
        <li>Vim-like keyboard bindings</li>

    </ul>
